# SlitherSnake

A low graphics quality attempt at replicating the popular 2000s snake game with extra features! :D
To start the game, double click on Snake x.y.jar. The values x and y depend upon the version of the game.
In this game, you are a snake trying to increase your length as much as possible by eating apples.
Eating an apple awards you with one point.
Apples are the red boxes visible on the board. In version 1.2, you can also see some yellow boxes.
The yellow boxes, when eaten, allow you to score 2 points when you eat an apple for the next 10 seconds.
The Snake can be moved by the arrow keys on the keyboard.
If the snake collides with itself, or hits the edge of the board, it dies, so be careful with your maneouvres.
When the game ends, You are given an option to close the game or restart the game.
The Game also allows you to edit certain settings of the game like the speed of the snake, the length and breadth 
of the Board.
The game can be edited by going into the prerequisites folder, and opening the settings.txt file.
In the settings file, the second line has 3 values. The first is rows, second is columns, and third is
speed multiplier. edit the values and save the file to implement the changes.
*REMEMBER: LOWER THE SPEED OF THE SNAKE, THE WORSE THE CONTROLS WILL FEEL*
